GitHub repository for Future Interns Data Science &amp; Analytics - Task 3 : College Event Feedback Analysis Project

Project Overview:-

This project focuses on analyzing student feedback collected from a college event. The primary goal is to uncover satisfaction trends, understand the sentiment behind detailed comments, and identify specific areas for improvement. The analysis integrates both quantitative ratings and qualitative textual feedback to provide comprehensive insights.

Skills Developed:-

Through the completion of this task, I have significantly enhanced my skills in:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processing raw survey data for analysis.

2. Sentiment Analysis (NLP): Categorizing textual feedback into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments to gauge overall emotional responses.

3. Survey Insights: Extracting meaningful patterns and conclusions from both structured ratings and unstructured text.

4. Demographic Analysis: Breaking down feedback by various student demographics (e.g., Age Group, Course, Gender, Year) to identify specific satisfaction segments.

5. Data Visualization and Charting: Creating clear and informative visual representations (bar charts, pie charts, word clouds) to present complex findings.

6. Recommendations: Translating data-driven insights into actionable suggestions for future event improvements.

Tools and Technologies Used:-

* Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook)

* Python

* Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)

* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
